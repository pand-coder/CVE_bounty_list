# 🛡️ CVE-2025-66036 – Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Retro Web Application

## **Description**
A **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability was discovered in the Retro open-source web application.  
Improper input validation and lack of output encoding allow user-supplied data to be reflected directly into the HTML response.  
A remote attacker can exploit this by crafting a malicious URL that executes arbitrary JavaScript in the victim’s browser.

This issue was responsibly reported and has been fixed by the vendor.

## **Proof of Concept (PoC)**

### **PoC URL**
The following crafted URL demonstrates the vulnerability:

https://example.com/retro/?search=<script>alert(1)</script>


### **Result**

- Execute JavaScript in the victim’s browser  
- Steal session cookies or sensitive data  
- Impersonate users  
- Redirect users to malicious sites
